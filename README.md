# Splinter
Set of simple tools to generate various types of hypothetical mutant DNA/RNA sequences from a single wildtype sequence. Mutagen.py takes as its input a single wildtype sequence and generates all the single_mutation permutations of that sequence. Ideally it reports the quantity of permutations and dumps all the hypothetical sequences to one of several filetypes for analysis.
